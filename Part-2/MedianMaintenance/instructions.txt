Question 1
Download the following text file:


Median
TXT File
The goal of this problem is to implement the "Median Maintenance" algorithm (covered in the Week 3 lecture on heap applications).  The text file contains a list of the integers from 1 to 10000 in unsorted order; you should treat this as a stream of numbers, arriving one by one.  Letting
x
i
x
i
​
  denote the
i
ith number of the file, the
k
kth median
m
k
m
k
​
  is defined as the median of the numbers
x
1
,
…
,
x
k
x
1
​
 ,…,x
k
​
 .  (So, if
k
k is odd, then
m
k
m
k
​
  is
(
(

/

)
((k+1)/2)th smallest number among
x

,
…

x

​

k
​
 ; if
k
k is even, then
m
k
m

​
  is the

(k/2)th smallest number among

 .)

In the box below you should type the sum of these 10000 medians, modulo 10000 (i.e., only the last 4 digits).  That is, you should compute
(
m
1
+
m
2

m
3

⋯
+
m
10000
)
 
 
10000
(m

​
 +⋯+m

​
 )mod10000.

OPTIONAL EXERCISE: Compare the performance achieved by heap-based and search-tree-based implementations of the algorithm.
